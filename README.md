Machine Learning Regression: Predict the price of a diamond


Data on diamonds are readily available on the web - all we need to do is mine it (ironic, eh?).

In this series of notebooks, we mine diamond data from numerous sources to build a dataset to perform machine learning on. We'll attempt to build a regressor to predict price of diamonds.

This kind of algorithm has applications in predicting the price of a diamond when merchants don't display their price, and you want an idea on how much it'll set you back.
