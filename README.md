## Introduction
Machine Learning Regression: Predict the price of a diamond

Data on diamonds are readily available on the web - all we need to do is mine it (ironic, eh?).

The project aims to web scrape data off of diamond websites, and use machine learning to accurately predict the price of a diamond. This can be really useful in assessing which diamonds are well priced and which are overpriced. 

## Web Scraping 
For the record, I do not condone the use of web scraping for any website. Anyone who does choose to web scrape, please do follow the best practises implemented in the scripts as these are there to prevent the websites being significantly affected by our use.
